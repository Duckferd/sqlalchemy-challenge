# sqlalchemy-challenge
Module 10 SQLalchemy challenge

####Project Description:
This is the assignment submission for challenge #10- SQLalchemy. The solution was completed in Jupyter Notebook via SQLite Connection as well as using a flask API creation script for the same SQLITE Connection. 

####Getting Started and Installation:
For the Jupyter Notebook File "Climate_Starter":
This project is written using Python in Jupyter Notebook, which you must install and use to run this script with. 

Download the repository. You can place the repository anywhere you want in the drive, however keep the file structure the same as the script relies on the resources folder being available in a certain spot to reference. 

Open the file in Jupyter Notebook. You can either run the code as-is or read the outputs of each cell. 

For the Flask API file "App.py":
start the API in terminal (e.g. Git Bash). Click on the IP link to open the API webpage and enter parameters to navigate through each of the static and dynamic routes.

The following are uploaded to Github:
All original folders including resources
Modified "Climate_starter.ipynb" with challenge solutions.
